### WELCOME 

I am a data scientist exploring how AI and data science can contribute to improving the quality of life of individuals with disabilities. 

My PhD thesis characterized and detected episodes of aberrant behavior in the "fight or flight" response (Autonomic Dysreflexia) in people with spinal cord injuries.

With the abundance of data in healthcare and more accessible machine learning algorithms, we can develop systems to predict onset of various disease states. 
My aim is to combine these tools to allow an improved "quantified self".  

#### My technical capabilities include:
- Machine Learning
- Signal Processing
- Biomedical data analysis (ECG, PPG, EEG, EMG)
- Healthcare Statistics
- Assistive and Wearable Technologies
- Entrepreneurship (Business model development+ pitching)
