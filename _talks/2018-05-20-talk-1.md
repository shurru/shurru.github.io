One of the most common and serious health conditions after a spinal cord injury is Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) and if poorly managed, it can lead to death. We developed an app coupled with commercially available sensors to enable wearers to develop a universal recognition system to reliably detect the onset of AD without prior training. The system is easy to use, comfortable to wear and most importantly, helpful to individuals who experienced AD. The goal of this
system is to assist newly injured individuals to train themselves to identify their own AD symptoms and provide continuous medical oversight.
